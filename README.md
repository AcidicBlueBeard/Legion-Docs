## Our Creed
**Leg1on was founded on the sense of community. Everyone in Leg1on may have a different username, they may speak a different language, they may have a unique personality, but in the end, we are all part of the same community. The Legion motto, "Many Names. Many People. One Kingdom." stands true. You hurt one, you hurt all of us. One wins, we all win. Everyone in Leg1on is there for one another, from one end of the earth to the other, always and never yeilding.**
